Hi, I’m @erwinmintiens

I’m interested in Python mainly but I am looking to learn new languages.
I am a supporter of Free Open Source Software (FOSS) and a Linux enthousiast.

Things I like:
- FOSS
- Linux (and tweaking my setup)
- Development (and learning new tips and tricks about this)
- Gaming
- Software privacy
